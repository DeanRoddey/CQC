This is a list of the faux product type/product ids we use for our generic handlers. We need to have unique Card8 encoded ids for every device info file.

We assume no real manufacturer will have an id of 0xFFFF, so we use that to represent ourself for these fake ids sets. We set 0xFFFF as the product type, which basically represents 'faux product type'. Then we just have to have a unique product id for each generic handler.
