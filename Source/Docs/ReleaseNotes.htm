<h2 align="center">CQC Release Notes<br>Version: 6.0.1</h2>
<p>This document contains notes about the 6.0.1 version of CQC. .</p>

<p><i>To upgrade from any version prior to 5.4.914 you must first upgrade to the <a href="http://www.charmedquark.com/web2/Downloads/Installers/Beta/CQCInstSE_5_4_914.exe">5.4.914 version</a>. This will do some moving around of things to prepare for the open source version, and also putting in place more security. Then you must upgrade to the <a href="http://www.charmedquark.com/web2/Downloads/Installers/Beta/CQCInstSE_5_4_917.exe">5.4.917 version</a>, which will complete the process and remove the licensing system. After that you can move forward to a 6.x version.</i></p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>If you are a new user, then you will need to download the installer and will likely want to go through the tutorial videos, which will take you on a very useful tour through the capabilities of CQC. On the Charmed Quark <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charmedquark.com">web site</a>, use the Get Started button in the header area to find information about downloading the installer and how to find the tutorial videos. For more technical and in-depth documentation, once you have CQC installed, there is extensive written documentation under the /Help section of the main browser tree of the Administrative Interface.</p>

<p>There are plenty of tutorial and training videos available on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CharmedQuarkSystems" target="_blank"> Youtube account</a> and those should probably be your starting point. Don't read the written docs until you just get yourself overwhelmed.</p>


<h3>Upgrading from Previous Versions</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">IMPORTANT&gt;&gt;&gt; Read this section</font></p> </blockquote>

<p class="style1">As of version 4.7, Windows 7 is the minimum Windows version. CQC will no longer run on Vista or XP versions. The server equivalent of Windows 7 is Server 2008R2, so you'll need at least that version if you are running Windows Server for your back end.</p>

<p>As of the 6.x versions (well, actually the 5.4.917 and up versions) there are new security concerns that you need to address. The installer will explain these. Don't ignore them.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Upgrade Procedure</h4>

<p>The absolutely safest upgrade procedure is as follows, and we strongly recommend you do it th is way.</p>
<ul>
    <li>On each machine, starting with the client machines and doing the master server last, stop any CQC client applications, and then stop the CQC services. Be sure that no other programs have open files in the CQC directory are are using any CQC directories as their current directory, since this will prevent CQC from moving or renaming those directories. It must do these directory moves in order to complete the install.</li>
    <li>Upgrade the master server machine, after doing the above steps on it as well, and make sure that it comes up ok. Allow the installer to create a backup for you so that you can get back to the current configuration. Preferably let it back up to another hard drive than the one CQC is
    installed on, for redudancy.</li>
    <li>Upgrade the other machines and test them out, secondary servers first, and then straight client machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are running a single machine configuration, then your master server and client machines are the same, but the process is the same otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Notable Changes</h2>

<p>This section list notable changes by version, so that you can know what to expect after your upgrade.</p>

<h3>Version 6.0.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Versions 5.4.919 through 6.0.0 failed to correctly copy forward the Logic Server configuration so you would lose your Logic Server fields.</li>
    <li>6.0.0 started automatically selecting the secure connection to the MS Web Server for help. But, some folks use that for external connection from outside the home, so that won't work. They need to be able to select the connection to use.</li>
    <li>Added a hot link in the /Help section of the Admin Interface for CIDLib/CQC development stuff</li>
    <li>More CIDLib/CQC source code high level documentation content was added</li>
    <li>RCS serial thermo driver wasn't working for multi-drop setups because of a field id lookup issue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Removing CQC</h3>

<p>If you want to de-install CQC, run the CQC uninstaller from the Charmed Quark section of the start menu. This will stop and remove the service, remove any registry entries, and remove the start menu item. When the de-installer completes, you can remove the CQC directory and that will leave no remnants of CQC on your system. CQC does not install or upgrade any system files, so it will not affect your system in any way once you have removed it.</p>

<p>Don't delete the CQC directory first, since the uninstaller is in that directory. Run the uninstaller first, and when it is complete, you can remove the directory. Be sure to stop any CQC GUI applications before you run the uninstaller and try to remove the directory.</p>
